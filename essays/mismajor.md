When I began my time at UH Manoa in August of 2018, I had been a Math Education major. However, after looking over the major program for any teacher going into Secondary Education at UH Manoa, I decided against that route. I still see teaching as a possibility for me but since then, I have switched to majoring in Accounting and just recently decided to also pursue a double major in MIS instead of Finance.

I am majoring in MIS for two main reasons. The first is that I plan to obtain my CPA license and I will need to have completed 150 credit hours in order to do so. Second, more and more accountants are finding themselves using different programs and technological tools in their work. I believe double majoring in Accounting and MIS will be more profitable to me than doubling in Accounting and Finance.

My grandmother has always encouraged me to get into learning code since “computers are the future” so I suppose I am finally taking her advice by taking this class. I’m very excited to learn different coding languages and challenge myself with this course.
